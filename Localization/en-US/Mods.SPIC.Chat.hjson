	'''
	After 3+ years of work (and 3 complete reworks), SPIC is finally finished!
	Thank you for downloading and using this over-engineered mod of mine.

	v4.0 is (probably) the last major update this mod will have.
	I will still maintain the mod and release patches when needed but I implemented everything I planned to.

	Small sidenote, I you are a mod developer and want to add new Infinities there's an API you can use the create Infinities, Presets and Displays.

Changelog:
	'''
	- Fixed falling blocks dropping items when landing on background objects
	- Fixed falling blocks infinite data not been cleared when falling when placed
